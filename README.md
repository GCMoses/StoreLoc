# StoreLoc
Created a StoreLocator web API... 

Used Entity Framework Core for Database

Logging using SeriLog

Understand the REST design principles to me which is very similar to CRUD 

My favorite is Dependancy Injection

Implementing user Authentication work using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). ðŸ˜£

UnitOfWork and repository patterns

Use Swagger to get all endpoint results

Used Postman for a better UI and and more features in Postman than Swagger UI

Get, Post, Put, Patch, and Delete.

Still easier in JavaScript thoðŸ˜†
